code_swarm is an experiment in organic software visualization.

to produce.

I) Building 

More detail is available at http://code.google.com/p/codeswarm/wiki/HowtoBuild

This quick guide explains how to setup your development environment to build
the binary (ie. jar) version of code_swarm from Java sources.

I.1) Prerequisites
You will need the "Ant" software building tool, and the Java SDK from sun
(no idea if another SDK could do the job).
If Java and Ant aren't installed, you'll need a bit of familiarity with installing
software packages on your platform.  A 

I.1.a) Linux
This guide is written with a Debian based Linux, Ubuntu 8.04. It would requires
some minor adaptation to use on other distribution (other packaging systems).

 * install ant with the following command (or with your favorite graphical package manager) 
    sudo apt-get install ant 

 * install sun-java-jdk 1.5 or 1.6 following your distribution recommendation 
    sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk 

 * configure the Java SDK to specify the new installation path, for instance on Ubuntu : 
    sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun 

   See http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/java

I.1.b) Windows
 * download ant for all platforms at http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
 * unpack it where you want it to be installed, and add the location of
   its binaries to the the "PATH" environment variable. For instance, add at the end : 
   "C:\apache-ant-1.7.0\bin;" 

 * download Sun Java SDK at http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
 * install it and add the "javac" Java compiler to the PATH : 
   "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin;" 

 * then create a new environment variable called JAVA_HOME and set its paht to 
   "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06;" 

I.2) Getting the source code

code_swarm's source code is on a Google Code Subversion repository (svn) :
http://codeswarm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

See Subversion homepage at http://subversion.tigris.org/ for all appropriate 
tools and documents. I would recommend "TortoiseSVN" for Windows users. 
Unix-like users would get their native "Subversion" package.

For more information, see http://code.google.com/p/codeswarm/source/checkout

I.3) Building the sources

With that out of the way, building and running code_swarm is quite easy:

 * Open a terminal/command line shell
 * cd path/to/code_swarm
 * ant run

Alternatively, you can just try the "run.sh" or "run.bat" scripts to get it
done in once, but you'll need to rebuild manually if you modify the source code.

Other commands:
 * "ant" will build, but not run
 * "ant all" will also generate Javadoc HTML documentation
 * "ant clean" will delete all intermediate and binary files
