# Building #

More detail is available at http://code.google.com/p/codeswarm/wiki/HowtoBuild

This quick guide explains how to setup your development environment to build
and run code_swarm.


## Prerequisites ##

You will need Apache's "ant" build tool, and at least version 5 of the Java SDK from Sun.

If you don't have Java and Ant installed, you'll need to get them.  Here's an overview,
broken down by operating system.

### Linux ###

This guide is written with a Debian based Linux, Ubuntu 8.04. The process is likely
to be similar with other linux distributions.

This should ensure that ant and java6 are installed and configured:

    sudo apt-get install ant 
    sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk 
    sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun 


### Windows ###

* download ant for all platforms at http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
* unpack it where you want it to be installed, and add the location of
  its binaries to the the `PATH` environment variable. For instance, add at the end : 
  `C:\apache-ant-1.7.0\bin;` 

* download Sun Java SDK at http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
* install it and add the "javac" Java compiler to the PATH : 
  `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin;`

* then create a new environment variable called JAVA_HOME and set its path to 
  `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06;`

### Mac ###

Recent versions of OS X come with a good java compiler, so all you need to do
is get and install Apache ant.

If you have DarwinPorts/MacPorts, you can simply:
    sudo port install apache-ant

## Getting the source code ##

### Subversion ###

code_swarm's source code is on a Google Code Subversion repository (svn) :
http://codeswarm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

See Subversion homepage at http://subversion.tigris.org/ for all appropriate 
tools and documents. I would recommend [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) for Windows users. 
Unix-like users would get their native "Subversion" package.

For more information, see http://code.google.com/p/codeswarm/source/checkout

### git ###

A git copy of the code_swarm repository is maintained at <http://github.com/rictic/code_swarm/tree/master>

To obtain a clone of the repository, simply use:

    git clone git://github.com/rictic/code_swarm.git


## Building the sources ##

With that out of the way, building and running code_swarm is quite easy:

In your terminal/command line:
    cd path/to/code_swarm
    ant run

Alternatively, you can just try the `run.sh` or `run.bat` scripts after you've built
the project, but you'll need to rebuild manually if you modify the code_swarm source.

Other commands:

* `ant` will build, but not run the project
* `ant all` will also generate Javadoc HTML documentation
* `ant clean` will delete all intermediate and binary files
