code_swarm is an experiment in organic software visualization.

# Building #

More detail is available at http://code.google.com/p/codeswarm/wiki/HowtoBuild

This quick guide explains how to setup your development environment to build
the binary (ie. jar) version of code_swarm from Java sources.


## Prerequisites ##

You will need the "Ant" software building tool, and the Java SDK from Sun
(no idea if another SDK could do the job).
If Java and Ant aren't installed, you'll need a bit of familiarity with installing
software packages on your platform.

### Linux ###

This guide is written with a Debian based Linux, Ubuntu 8.04. The process is likely
to be similar with other linux distributions.

This should ensure that ant and java6 are installed and configured:

    sudo apt-get install ant 
    sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk 
    sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun 


### Windows ###

* download ant for all platforms at http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
* unpack it where you want it to be installed, and add the location of
  its binaries to the the `PATH` environment variable. For instance, add at the end : 
  `C:\apache-ant-1.7.0\bin;` 

* download Sun Java SDK at http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
* install it and add the "javac" Java compiler to the PATH : 
  `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin;`

* then create a new environment variable called JAVA_HOME and set its path to 
  `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06;`



## Getting the source code ##

### Subversion ###

code_swarm's source code is on a Google Code Subversion repository (svn) :
http://codeswarm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

See Subversion homepage at http://subversion.tigris.org/ for all appropriate 
tools and documents. I would recommend [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) for Windows users. 
Unix-like users would get their native "Subversion" package.

For more information, see http://code.google.com/p/codeswarm/source/checkout

### git ###

A git copy of the code_swarm repository is maintained at <http://github.com/rictic/code_swarm/tree/master>

To obtain a clone of the repository, simply use:

    git clone git://github.com/rictic/code_swarm.git


## Building the sources ##

With that out of the way, building and running code_swarm is quite easy:

In your terminal/command line:
    cd path/to/code_swarm
    ant run

Alternatively, you can just try the `run.sh` or `run.bat` scripts to get it
done in once, but you'll need to rebuild manually if you modify the source code.

Other commands:
 * `ant` will build, but not run
 * `ant all` will also generate Javadoc HTML documentation
 * `ant clean` will delete all intermediate and binary files
